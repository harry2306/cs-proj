# Reinforcement Learning Pool AI
### Goal: Train an agent to learn how to play pool by trial and error. 
Description: Using a pool engine contructed from scratch using the Pygame and Math module, a agent will learn to finish a solo game of pool by following a reinforcement learning procedure, enumerated below:

table state $\to$ agent chooses a shot $\to$ pool engine simulates the physics $\to$ reward $\to$ new table state

General Objective:
1. Pool Scenary
2. Implement the classes and internal structure
3. Implement an approximation of pool physics
4. Create a reinforcement learning enviroment
5. Train an agent to pocket balls
6. Experimentation and Evaluation

## Implementation Techniques

### Reinforcement Learning with PPO

This project will use **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to train the learning agent. PPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is commonly used for environments with continuous action spaces, making it a good fit for this project because a pool shot can be represented by continuous values such as angle and power.

A good idea would be to begin will be to proceed evalulation with a single ball and see how it preforms on this simple case. 

### Packages
1. Stable_Baselines3
2. Gymanasium
   Gymnasium is the communication system between the engine software and an
reinforcement learning algorithm. Gymnasium defines an environment as object that an agent can interact with through a fixed API. 
```text
|Learning Agent| -> |gymnasium| -> |engine|
  ^                 |    ^            |
  | _  _  _  _  _  _|    |  _   _   _ |
             closed loop

There are several abilities that gymansium needs to 
be able to do:
1. should hold some data structure holding data that the agent observes call it the observation.
2. there should be data indicating the possible choices the agent has.
3. rest your enviroment [reset()]
    |___ cue ball at the starting position
    |___ object ball at the starting position
    preferably the agent should know that we reseted so some parameter might need to be passed.

```

4. Numpy

### Task 1:
For a solo pool game the AI engine should be able to command a shot based on two parameters [angle,power]
